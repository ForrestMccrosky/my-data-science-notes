## Takeaways
The biggest take way for me today is going to be practice practice practice. 
I had to redo excercise 1 several times from scratch until I finally grapsed the actual concept of making a repository. Making all the other excercises much easier to understand. 

Also it is 100 percent easier for me to use the cloning method to create a repository by starting on github and using the "git clone" command with the ssh key. 

This allows for easier and cleaner commands in the terminal with the adding, commiting, and pushing.

## Notes:

Repository aka Repo = folder

Git is a distributed version control system.
So What does this mean?
    Means We will need to save our changes.

In git we will be creating repositories 
    These repositories will serve as a backup for work/excercises/projects and allow the instructors to view our code.

Keep in mind git does not run the code. It simply serves as a backup and viewing platform.

When creating repositories the method that I have found to be the easiest is using github.com/new and naming a depository then cloning it to the computer on ther terminal with the ssh key using the "git clone" command.

## Key commands

git status - as long as you are in the git repository on your terminal this will track any changes by providing color coded updates for your work. Ex: (red for non added edited material and green for edited and added material using the "git add file_name" command)

git diff - physically see the changes made while editing files inside your repositories 
git add - adds files

git commit - seals the envelope after you have double checked for erros using status and other commands.

git push - the final command to push the work to git hub and save you commits on your repositories.

## Other 

.gitignore is important

While using github keep in mind anything you push will be able to be veiwed by everybody if your repository is set to public upon creation.

However, git is programmed to ignore things under ".gitignore" 

Therefore it is possible to hide certain files contents by adding there names to a .gitignore file if you do not want that information published but still want it inside the repository for reference.
