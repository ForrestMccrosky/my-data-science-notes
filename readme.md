## Takeaways
The biggest take way for me today is going to be practice practice practice. 
I had to redo excercise 1 several times from scratch until I finally grapsed the actual concept of making a repository. Making all the other excercises much easier to understand. 

Also it is 100 percent easier for me to use the cloning method to create a repository by starting on github and using the "git clone" command with the ssh key. 

This allows for easier and cleaner commands in the terminal with the adding, commiting, and pushing.
